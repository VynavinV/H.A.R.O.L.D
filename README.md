HAROLD is a new, innovative rover that is capable of 3D Printing houses on the Lunar Surface & other worlds. HAROLD stands for Hydrogen Activated Rover - Outpost Lunar Device. HAROLD uses materials from the Moon, eliminating the hassle of bringing materials using rockets. HAROLD will be sent as a precursor to crewed missions to the Moon, as it can build a mini lunar base for the astronauts to stay in.
